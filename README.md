# Prayer-Times

**Status:** ðŸš§ On Standby

---

### Project Overview

**Prayer-Times** was initiated as a tool to simplify prayer time reminders for Muslim students. The idea is to provide an easy, one-button solution to integrate daily prayer times into Outlook calendars. The application aims to retrieve daily Hidri prayer times using a `GET` request and seamlessly create corresponding events in the user's Outlook schedule using Microsoft Graph API.

### Project Purpose

The project was intended to serve Muslim students within the McMaster University community, offering them a quick way to access and manage their prayer times through their existing Outlook accounts.
<u> I also just wanted to see my prayers, so I didn't have to keep relying on an external app. </u>

---

### Project Status

The project is currently on hold due to a lack of access to Microsoft Azure Entra, which is necessary for using the Microsoft Graph API for calendar integrations. Free access to Azure Entra could not be obtained, resulting in a temporary halt in development. Once Azure access is secured, development will resume to enable seamless scheduling of prayer times.

### Planned Functionality

1. **GET Request for Hidri Prayer Times:** 
   - Retrieve daily Hidri prayer times from a reliable API source.
     **Completed**

2. **POST Request to Outlook Calendar:**
   - Create events for each prayer time in the Outlook calendar via the Microsoft Graph API, helping users get timely prayer reminders directly within their schedules.

### Current Roadblock

Development is paused until access to Microsoft Azure can be funded. Microsoft Graph API integration for Outlook events requires Entra, which is currently inaccessible without paid Azure access <u> which I don't want to pay for </u>.

Within Github PRO / Student Developer Program, I have like $135 monthy spending limit but my school needs to give me access to do this and do it at scale for other students.

I found an alternative solution online called [PrayerCal](https://www.prayercal.com/), which was funny enough exactly what I was looking to do.

**However, just because I found an alternative solution; doesn't mean I am stopping this one!**

### Potential Impact

When complete, **Prayer-Times** will serve as a useful tool for the McMaster Muslim community, allowing them to integrate prayer reminders effortlessly into their daily schedules.
